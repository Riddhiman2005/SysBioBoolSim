# **Decrypting-the-Relation-of-Dark-Matter-and-Quantum-Entanglement** #


The nature of dark matter is one of the most fascinating and mysterious questions in modern physics. While dark matter has been detected through its gravitational effects, its composition and properties remain largely unknown. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in exploring the potential connection between dark matter and quantum entanglement.
This review paper explores the hypothesis that dark matter particles may be composed of particles that are entangled with each other [** the dark matter in the universe has quantum entanglement if the dark matter
is a Bose-Einstein condensation of ultra-light scalar particles**]. The paper begins by providing an overview of the properties of dark matter, including its observed distribution in the universe, and the challenges that have been encountered in attempts to detect it directly.
The paper then provides an introduction to the concept of **quantum entanglement** - a fundamental property of quantum mechanics that allows particles to remain in communication with each other even when they are separated by large distances. The review paper explores some of the theoretical proposals that have been put forward to explore the connection between dark matter and quantum entanglement and discusses the mathematical framework for this proposal and explores how it could potentially explain some of the observed properties of dark matter.

The review paper also examines other proposals that explore the connection between dark matter and quantum entanglement, such as the idea that dark matter particles could interact through the weak force, which is responsible for radioactive decay, and that this interaction could be mediated by quantum entanglement.

In addition to exploring the theoretical proposals, the review paper also examines the experimental evidence that has been collected to date. While there is currently no direct experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that dark matter particles are composed of entangled sub-particles, the paper discusses how future experiments could potentially test this hypothesis.

Finally, the review paper concludes with a discussion of the broader implications of the connection between dark matter and quantum entanglement. If the hypothesis that dark matter particles are composed of entangled sub-particles is confirmed, it could have profound implications for our understanding of the nature of the universe and the fundamental principles of physics.

In conclusion, this review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on the connection between dark matter and quantum entanglement. While there is still much work to be done in order to establish a definitive link between these two fundamental concepts, the paper highlights the exciting potential for future research to shed light on one of the most mysterious questions in modern physics
